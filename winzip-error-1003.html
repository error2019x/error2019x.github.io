<p>ZIP's biggest rival, WINRAR, is quietly on the rise. Winzip was already held compression bound <br>
but with the emergence of version 2.7, Wrar is growing, both unusually fierce struggle (note: like Winzip, in fact
as early as the DOS era, there is a DOS version of RAR, <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>just RAR in the DOS era ARJ enemy but can only use the command line
in the era of Windows and staggered Winzip attack,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> because the RAR compression ratio is low and slow
and RAR compressed format has been the lack of the support of other software before, cause the WinRAR has widely popular).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As far as the performance of both at that time, Winzip compression only support ZIP format
decompression support ZIP, CAB, TAR, GZip, UUencode, XXencode, BinHex<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
MIME and other Internet commonly used formats (you can see the focus of Winzip)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
ARJ, LHA and ARC need the corresponding plug-in program.<br><br><br><br><br><br> But WinZip with Windows explorer is very close<br><br><br><br><br><br>
the most commonly used compression and decompression operations have been integrated into the right mouse button menu
click the right button can be easily completed compression decompression. <br><br><br><br><br>
And added a lot of humanized functions such as E-mail function, volume compression<br><br><br><br>
password encryption; So why should Winrar compete with him? The answer is format support and functionality!<br><br><br>
WinRAR compression format support their own RAR and ZIP(can be "compatible" ZIP)<br><br>
decompression support RAR, ZIP, CAB, ACE, ARJ, LHA, TAR, GZip, UUE, basically common have. <br><br>
WinRAR in the interface similar to WinZip in the basic functions of WinZip some of it<br>
and even a lot of better than WinZip is more powerful. The "Repair archive" feature can even Repair damaged zip files. <br><br><br><br>
The Convert archive to SFX "function converts RAR and ZIP files to self-extracting files. <br><br><br>
Unlike WinZip, you can save them as self-extracting files when compressed... <br><br>
Take the essence of the opponent, and improve it, this is why Winrar dares to challenge the compression industry leader.<br>

At this point, you might ask: why doesn't zip support rar? Isn't the competition "fair"?<br><br><br><br>
But here's what I'm telling you: the zip format is open, and any compression software is free to use. <br><br><br>
RAR is the proprietary algorithm for RARLab, and other software must pay a fee to be licensed to support it. <br><br>
We must understand: winzip and winrar are sharing software, the Chinese used to pirated winrar<br>
think rar is the king of compression format, if you think that the whole world's compression software should support rar format
then can only say that this is a very absurd cognition.</p>
